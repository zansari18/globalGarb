            <h1>Why You Care</h1>
            <p> Clothing seems universal yet personal, but global fashion reveals how we are deeply shaped 
                by our history, power, and deep cultural exchange. A piece of fabric represents centuries of 
                trade routes, colonization, and the movement of ideas. Whether you wear a sari, tux, kimono, 
                or a pair of jeans, it carries a history of dominant values, whose aesthetics were preserved from 
                them, and whose were rewritten and reinvented. To honor the global closet means acknowledging the 
                forces that shape identity, the old clothes, and the choices we make every day on how to present 
                ourselves. Once you understand the global system behind the fabric and its pieces, fashion  becomes 
                more than what you chose to wear that day. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Woven Fabric of the Globe</h2>
            <p> Textiles are the earliest global connectors before globalization existed. Silk traveled 
                accross Asia, dyes passed through Egypt, India, Japan, and West Africa, and cotton moved
                through shipping routes. Indigo is now important for denim, kente patterns are used as 
                blueprints for global fashion, and colors become an international symbol. Each place on the globe 
                reveals the intricate weaving and patterns of history. Traditions cannot be isolated as they
                are built on centuries of shared teechniques, borrowed aesthetics, and stolen practices.
                Clothing is a map of global relations. 
            </p>
            <h2>Honoring or Appropriating?</h2>
            <p> As traditional garments travel, their meanings change, sometimes celebrating culture, other times 
                commercializing it. Kente cloth comes to mind: it became mass-produced without acknowledging its 
                background. The dupatta or head covering becomes a scandinavian scarf, the traditional South Asian 
                motifs become Western fast fashion, and the Kimono shape is put on runways with no contribution to 
                Japanese culture. On the other hand, the Western tuxedo spreads as a default for professionalism and
                formality. What becomes universalized? What becomes exotic? Honoring traditional attire is understanding 
                the weight of its significance to that culture, while appropriation is ignoring the meaning or rewriting 
                it. 
            </p>
            <h2>Who Designs the Global Closet?</h2>
            <p> The modern “global closet” isn’t created by a single culture—it’s shaped by media industries, trade networks, 
                colonization, and digital platforms. K-pop reshapes fashion from Seoul to the US. Secondhand clothing markets
                push Western styles across Africa and Asia. Fast fashion companies decide which cultural motifs become trends. 
                Diaspora communities create hybrid styles that travel back to their home countries. And yet, Western standards
                of dress—like suits, tuxedos, and denim—still dominate global definitions of formality and modernity. This 
                raises the question of who has the cultural power to define what is fashionable, appropriate, or modern. 
                The answer reveals how globalization is not just movement, but negotiation—between tradition and trend, 
                authenticity and commercialization, identity and influence.
