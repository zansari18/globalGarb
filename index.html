            <h1>Why Should the World Tell Me What to Wear?</h1>
            <p>  Fashion is a form of art in and of itself, a way of self-expression, and a marker 
                of identity. From the beginning of time, clothing has been used to both highlight and 
                absorb culture, characterizing cultures and subcultures. The concept of fashion arguably 
                comes from impression after all, since in the words of Immanuel Kant, “the human being 
                has the natural tendency to compare his behavior to that of a more important person”. 
                It is the pursuit of the new, the new ‘standard’ of beauty, as depicted in movies, 
                television, magazines, news, and radio. No matter how much you try not to change your 
                style, you are forever under the influence of media sources. Comparatively, it is the 
                very basis for globalization and modernization, A.K.A. ‘the new norm’.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Globalization?</h2>
            <p> Globalization is used to define the relationship of international, national, state, 
                and local as a form of worldwide interconnectedness. It takes its form through concepts
                 like colonialism, imperialism, populism, cultural difference, and glocalization, as well 
                 as economically, politically, culturally, socially, and digitally. The world isn’t exactly
                 unionizing solely through tradition and identity but hybridity and deterritorialization,
                 which is spread through media, making connections.
            </p>
            <h2>Clothes and Tradition</h2>
            <p> Clothing is its own lens for globalization. Garments can represent religion, status, culture, 
                and importantly, tradition. Long before deterritorialization, global textile and dye were connected
                 across continents. For example, silk originated in the Henan Province in China, and spread as a form 
                 of currency through China and eventually all of the East from the Silk Road. The color blue also has 
                 roots in many cultures like Egypt, Italy, and many European countries as a color of wealth, mainly 
                 because early forms of blue were from Afghanistan using a stone known as lapis lazuli, deemed a rare
                 and expensive material. These cultural roots in clothing are still persistent today, through traditions 
                 such as kente cloth, the national cloth of Ghana. Kente cloth is made by unraveling silks and fabrics 
                 from various different countries and is only worn on ceremonial occasions. The process of making indigo 
                 dye in Japan, known as Aizome, is used in Japanese fabrics and american jeans and still uses traditional 
                 methods of production. Traditional Tamil clothing, depending on the region, implements the silk sari. It 
                 is a long cloth draped around the waist and shoulder, paired with a blouse, a sign of auspiciousness. Its 
                 colors, fabrics, and blouse reflect centuries of colonialization and cultural exchange to its own form of 
                 regional identity.
            </p>
            <h2>Tradition to Trend</h2>
            <p> Fashion has progressed under the influence of culture and media. Through magazines, social media, news, and 
                radio, fashion continues to hybridize, localize, and globalize. As mentioned, the color blue was once an expensive
                 pigment and has now traveled globally through trade and has become a universal cultural symbol of labor for 
                 Japanese aizome, West African resist-dyeing (obroni wawa), and the American blue jeans. Silk is still used in 
                 many cultures and is a symbol of wealthy fashion to this day. Colonial governments introduced dress codes, 
                 which changed and invented traditions that fit Western ideas of ethnicity and culture. Post-colonialism, some 
                 nations reinvented traditional clothing through colonialism as a symbol of identity. When traditional clothing 
                 enters global markets, the history is overshadowed by media and commercial aesthetics. Things like kimono 
                 sleeves, kente patterns, or even gold jewelry are rebranded as trends. Things like second-hand clothing markets
                 in Ghana create hybrid styles where Western clothing is adapted into traditional Ghanian garments. Ironically, 
                 some Western consumers wear ‘ethnic’ or ‘exotic’ garments as a form of hybridization. The whole Korean Wave is
                 influenced by hanbok-inspired fashion and K-fashion aesthetics, advertised through media platforms, magazines, 
                 and pop stars, almost reinventing tradition.
